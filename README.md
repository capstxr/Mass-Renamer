Directory renamer written in c#.
Easy to use and modify, currently will change <b>every</b> file to your desired file format.
I mainly use this to quickly rename my video game clips.

2. Open program
3. Input your file extension; for example: jpg
4. Input your directory Directory; for example C:\\Windows\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Folder
5. Press enter
6. Wait for the program to finish.
