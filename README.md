# Mass-Renamer

Directory renamer written in c#.
Easy to use and modify, currently will only see .mp4 files.
I only use this to quickly rename my video game clips.

Usage:
1. Open program
2. Input your Directory; for example C:\\Windows\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Folder
3. Wait for the program to finish.
